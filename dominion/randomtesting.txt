For the adventurer, I didn't get trouble on line coverage, so there was no some big 
improvements.

For the dominion.c, I got 21.96% coverage, and this number is alomost same with my unit 
test coverage.
File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:21.96% of 560

For my first card steward, I got 100% coverage on the test and I didn't get trouble on 
the testing. the method that I test is that I print out the Hand, deck, card and corn 
number of before and after using card. If the numbers didn't have a proper change, so 
this test should failed.
	Function 'my_Smithy'
	Lines executed:100.00% of 5
	Branches executed:100.00% of 2


For my second card smithy, I also got 100% covergae. The test method is alsomost same 
with my steward card. Since I use same test method, There was no trouble.
	Function 'my_Smithy'
	Lines executed:100.00% of 5
	Branches executed:100.00% of 2

In my opinion, random test is better than unit test, since random can test more different 
situations than unit test. However, in a small program, unit test may easy to implement 
since random test is a huge program.
