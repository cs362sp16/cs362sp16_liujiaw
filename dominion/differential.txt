There is no difference if I use diff test my code and one of my classmate code, and with the seed 42. However, if I try to other seed 
such as 10 and 12, my program gives me FAILD. In addition, sometimes the program will shows segmentation fault to me. I think since there
are few bugs in dominion.c, that may cause my test crash. Since the output was same when the seed is 42, so it is easy to know that both
of us are correct.

After using diff, the result file is very difficult to read and the file is very long. That is one reason of differential testing is not
an ideal test. The second reason is that all results are based on random tests, so the result will be different. so it is very hard to
compare different files.

For my code coverage, I got almost 68% coverage, and it above 60%, although 68% is not very high, but it achieved the requirements.

Coverage:
File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:67.86% of 646
dominion.c:creating 'dominion.c.gcov'
