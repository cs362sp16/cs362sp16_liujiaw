Bug #1:

After my unit and random test, my test shows the hand card always left one card in 
player's hand, so there is one bug in "houw" code. 

In function "_cardEffect_minion", after the minion card, the user always have one same 
card with the previous hand cards.

Code and correction: 
In line 708

while(numHandCards(state) > 1) // the correct number should be 0
	    {
	      discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);
	    }



Bug #2:

After my unit and random test, the test shows that the fourth player's handcard number 
is never change when the total player number is more that 3. 

In the function "_cardEffect_smithy", after draw card, the fourth player's hand card 
number is not change.

Code and correction: 
In line 665

	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < 3; i++){ // the 3 should be replace by 4
		drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
	}
