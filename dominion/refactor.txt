case council_room: //#1
     return my_CouncilRoom(handPos, currentPlayer, state);

case smithy: //#2
     return my_Smithy(handPos, currentPlayer, state);
            
case village: //#3
     return my_Village(handPos, currentPlayer, state);

     return my_Steward(handPos, currentPlayer, choice1, choice2, choice3, state);

     return my_Salvager(handPos, currentPlayer, choice1, state);
