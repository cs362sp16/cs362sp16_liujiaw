Bug #3

After my random and unit test, the village card don't return a correct numActions, so 
there is a bug in the village crad.

In card village, the numActions should +2, but the code always give a reuslt with one 
more action (+3).

Code and correction:
In line 961

else{//Action Card
	  state->numActions = state->numActions + 2; // the 2 should be replace by 3
	}
